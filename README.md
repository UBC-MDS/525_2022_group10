# Daily rainfall over NSW, Australia

## Introduction
In this project we aim to predict the daily rainfall in Australia using an ensemble model and compare it to the actual values. The input to this model is the output of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall values. The data for this project is pretty huge (~6 GB). Therefore, we leverage cloud sources and deploy our model to the cloud so that everyone can use it.
